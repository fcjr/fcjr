**Hi, I'm Frank.**

I am a software engineer who loves privacy, security, and open source. I mostly write Go, TypeScript, & Python on personal projects, and Go, Swift, Java, and Kotlin for work. Though, I am actively learning and loving Rust.

I'll be attending the Summer 2 batch of [Recurse Center](https://github.com/recursecenter) starting June 30th, having recently left my role as tech lead and engineering manager at JPMorgan Chase's Global Business Accelerator. Prior to that, I served as a founding engineer at [@Svix](https://github.com/svix) (YC W21), where I helped build the company's initial platform and infrastructure. Before covid, I was the lead backend engineer at [@Ghostery](https://github.com/ghostery)/[@Cliqz](https://github.com/cliqz), working on anti-tracking software.

You can find more information about me and my work on my [personal website](https://frankchiarulli.com) or connect with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_fcjr). You can find my other social media profiles on [keybase](https://keybase.io/fcjr).
